## Things to work on

- stagger overlapping exposures
- load more patients
  - provide means to select patients by useful attributes
  - put patients in datatable, improve formatting
- distributions
  - Carsten's idea: break up gaps by exposure duration blocks
  - full height on hover
  - legend text for charts
  - hover over exposure duration
    - tooltip for all recs with same duration
    - filter gaps (and maybe all other distributions
      to records tied to hover region
  - fix y axis
  - make height consistent
  - fix choppy gap distributions (or are those meaningful?)
- connect to other data
  - overall patient timelines for individual patients
  - conditions, concomitant medications, measurements, demographics, etc.
